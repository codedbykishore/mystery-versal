# Mystery Versal üß©

**A Collaborative Cross-Community Puzzle Hunt for Reddit**

Mystery Versal is a revolutionary collaborative puzzle hunt game built on Reddit's Devvit platform that transforms how communities work together. Players embark on a cosmic journey across 9 different Reddit communities (r/Math, r/History, r/Codes, r/Science, r/Geography, r/Chemistry, r/Biology, r/Linguistics, r/Art) to solve interconnected puzzles, unlock new challenges, and reveal a final mystery message.

The game features real-time global progress sharing where every solved puzzle benefits the entire Reddit community - when ANY player solves a puzzle, it unlocks for EVERYONE worldwide within 5 seconds. This creates a truly collaborative gaming experience that spans multiple subreddits, with no competition, only cooperation.

Built with React, TypeScript, Express, and Framer Motion on the Devvit platform, Mystery Versal creates an immersive space-themed experience where each Reddit community is represented as a unique planet in a cosmic puzzle grid with stunning 60fps animations, intuitive interactive planet system, and real-time collaboration through optimistic UI updates.

When all 9 puzzles are solved, the complete message is revealed: **"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, SCATTERED ACROSS MANY MINDS, UNITED IN PURPOSE"** - embodying Reddit's collaborative spirit.

## üéÆ What is Mystery Versal?

Mystery Versal is an innovative cross-community puzzle hunt that creates a living, breathing collaborative experience across Reddit. The game presents players with a stunning space-themed visualization where 9 planets represent different Reddit communities (r/Math, r/History, r/Codes, r/Science, r/Geography, r/Chemistry, r/Biology, r/Linguistics, r/Art), each hosting unique puzzles.

**The Core Concept:**
Navigate a cosmic puzzle grid where each planet represents a Reddit community hosting a unique puzzle. Click on an unlocked planet to visit its puzzle page, then click through to the actual Reddit post in that community. Each puzzle is tailored to the community's expertise - math equations in r/Math, historical riddles in r/History, ciphers in r/Codes, and so on. Solve the puzzle, submit your answer, and unlock new planets for everyone playing the game.

**What Makes It Special:**
This isn't a single-player game - it's a global collaborative experience. When ANY player anywhere on Reddit solves a puzzle, it unlocks for EVERYONE within 5 seconds. Your progress contributes to a shared community achievement that persists across all players. The game features real-time synchronization with automatic polling every 5 seconds, so you'll see other players' contributions appear almost instantly.

The game uses a flexible branching progression system with three starting points (r/Math, r/History, r/Codes) and multiple paths that converge at r/Linguistics. This prevents bottlenecks and allows multiple players to work on different puzzles simultaneously.

As players solve puzzles, they unlock new challenges for the entire community and contribute to revealing a final message that embodies Reddit's collaborative spirit: **"KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, SCATTERED ACROSS MANY MINDS, UNITED IN PURPOSE"**.

**The Experience:**
- **Intro Page**: An animated splash screen with floating puzzle pieces, twinkling particles, and a purple gradient background welcomes players with three feature highlights before they begin their journey
- **Cosmic Grid**: A space-themed visualization with 9 planets arranged in a diagram, each with unique radial gradients, pulsing animations, and connection lines showing puzzle progression
- **Puzzle Pages**: Clean, focused interfaces where players visit Reddit posts, solve community-specific challenges, and submit answers
- **Victory Celebration**: A spectacular finale with 100+ confetti particles, trophy animations, and the complete 3x3 puzzle grid revealing the final message

## üéÆ Current Game Features & Implementation

### **üåü Fully Implemented Features**

**üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Planet System**
The game implements a sophisticated interaction system for maximum compatibility and accessibility:

- **SVG Planet Graphics**: Each planet is rendered as an SVG `<g>` element with visual elements (circles, gradients, animations) but with `pointerEvents: 'none'` to prevent interference
- **Absolute Positioned Buttons**: Transparent HTML buttons are positioned absolutely over each planet using percentage-based positioning calculated from SVG coordinates (left: `${(planet.x / 1000) * 100}%`, top: `${(planet.y / 700) * 100}%`)
- **Event Management**: Buttons use proper event handling with `onClick` handlers that call `handlePlanetClick()` to navigate to puzzle pages
- **Larger Click Areas**: Buttons extend beyond planet boundaries for better mobile UX (8% minimum width/height with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` for centering)
- **Proper Cursor States**: Visual feedback with `cursor-pointer` for unlocked planets and `cursor-not-allowed` for locked ones
- **Z-Index Management**: Buttons have `zIndex: 10` to ensure they're above SVG elements while maintaining proper layering

### **üéØ Strategic Progression System**

#### **üìä Flexible Progression System**
Unlike traditional linear unlocking, Mystery Versal features a **smart branching system** that provides multiple progression routes while maintaining logical flow:

**Three Primary Progression Chains**: 
- **Math Path**: Math ‚Üí Science ‚Üí Biology ‚Üí Linguistics
- **History Path**: History ‚Üí Geography ‚Üí Linguistics  
- **Codes Path**: Codes ‚Üí Chemistry ‚Üí Art ‚Üí Linguistics

**Smart Branching Logic**: 
- **Multiple Entry Points**: Three starting puzzles available immediately (Math, History, Codes)
- **Flexible Progression**: Work on any available puzzle - never get completely stuck on one challenge
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Up to 6 puzzles can be available simultaneously during mid-game

- **Community Coordination**: Multiple players can work on different available puzzles simultaneously

#### **üîç Following the Hint Chain System**
Each solved puzzle provides a cryptic hint that guides you to the next challenge in that specific path. This creates an authentic treasure hunt experience where discovery is part of the puzzle.

**How Hints Work:**
- **Path-Specific Clues**: Each hint points to the next puzzle in the same path only
- **Cryptic Language**: Hints require interpretation and don't directly state the answer
- **Subreddit Discovery**: Clues help you identify which community holds the next challenge
- **Answer Guidance**: Hints often contain numerical or conceptual clues about the solution

**Complete Hint Chain System:**

**Sequential Puzzle Flow with Hints:**
1. **r/Math (1)** ‚Üí Answer: "1" ‚Üí Hint: *"Navigate to r/History. The year you seek is 2."*
2. **r/History (2)** ‚Üí Answer: "2" ‚Üí Hint: *"Decode in r/Codes. The cipher key is 3."*
3. **r/Codes (3)** ‚Üí Answer: "3" ‚Üí Hint: *"Explore r/Science. The atomic number is 4."*
4. **r/Science (4)** ‚Üí Answer: "4" ‚Üí Hint: *"Navigate to r/Geography. The continent count is 5."*
5. **r/Geography (5)** ‚Üí Answer: "5" ‚Üí Hint: *"Mix in r/Chemistry. The carbon count is 6."*
6. **r/Chemistry (6)** ‚Üí Answer: "6" ‚Üí Hint: *"Study life in r/Biology. The pH level is 7."*
