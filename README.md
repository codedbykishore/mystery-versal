## 🌌 What is Mystery Versal?

**Mystery Versal** is Reddit's first true cross-community collaborative puzzle hunt. Nine challenges span nine subreddits, where progress is globally shared—when one player unlocks a puzzle, everyone benefits.

> *"Nine puzzles, nine communities, one universal truth."*

### ✨ The Magic of Collaboration

- 🧮 Mathematicians decode patterns in r/Math
- ⚗️ Scientists identify elements in r/Chemistry  
- 🏛️ Historians connect events in r/History
- 🔐 Coders crack ciphers in r/Codes
- 🌍 Geographers navigate rivers in r/Geography
- 🧬 Biologists analyze molecules in r/Biology
- 🎨 Artists recognize movements in r/Art
- 🗣️ Linguists solve the final riddle

**Every community contributes. Every solver matters. One shared victory.**

---

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🌍 Global Shared Progress
Unlike traditional games, **everyone plays the same puzzle**. When Player A in Tokyo solves Chemistry, Player B in London instantly sees that tile unlock. True collaboration.

### 🎨 Premium Design
- **Glassmorphism effects** and smooth animations
- **60fps performance** with Framer Motion
- **Mobile-responsive** grid that adapts beautifully
- **Confetti celebrations** on success 🎉

### 🔐 CTF-Quality Puzzles
Each challenge is:
- **Fair but challenging** (no impossible riddles)
- **Google-resistant** (requires thinking, not searching)
- **Community-specific** (leverages domain expertise)

### 🎭 The Meta-Mystery
There's a hidden puzzle within the puzzles. Discover what connects all nine answers—it's an unforgettable revelation.
